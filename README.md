# github_jupyterlab_demo

Demonstration for using google cloud, github and jupyterlab for teaching online classes. Student usernames will be created allowing a single student to take one or more courses using the same login. The goal would be that students in both classes will be able to use the shared folder content stored only at a single location. A student in each class will be distributed a copy of project materials as ***reference*** or a ***copy*** as and when they need to access.

The system is configured such that folders of content can be generated in 2 ways
- one is shared and protected distributed via a ***reference*** for all users needing the content for lookup and processing
- the other is shared and protected distributed via a ***copy*** for all users needing the content for modification in a versoin controlled environment specific to the user

The advantage is that some of the content will be shared from the common, protected shared location such that users will only have read access. This is good for large amounts of data as well as data that does not need to be replicated across multiple users and multiple projects. Also this data can be changed once by administrators (instructors) and will immediately be visible to all students. 

Imagine that we are teaching two classes - one at Bush School and another for Boyce Astro.  The 2 courses will share some of the content and other materials are specific to the user.  The can be distributed as a reference owned by the instructor or as a copy owned by the user.  

### Login to JupyterLab using the username assigned to you for each course you have registered for. Make sure it works and should give you an empty folder structure for each course.
